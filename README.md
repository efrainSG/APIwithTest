# APIwithTest
WebAPI project with unit tests

## Initialization
At the begining of the repo, I need to create a set of rules to ensure that the main branches will contain only functional code, this means that at least all de Unit Test cases must pass before merging.

## Start working
Once downloaded/cloned the repository, in the local machine is needed run **git flow init** and accept all the default confgurations, the goal is to ease the handle of branches and changes.

## Releasing
To do an automated release, it's required to create a new rule thorugh *Github Actions*
